#Attendance Management
Hey there, everyone!

I'm excited to share that I've created an attendance management website using the MERN stack. This tool allows you to download attendance records as CSV files, giving you the flexibility to select a date and get a list of students who were present or absent on that day.

By default, the attendance period is set to one month, specifically June. However, you can easily change this. You can modify the code to query the start and end dates or add input boxes on the website. Once connected to the backend, you'll be able to set your desired date range effortlessly.

If you encounter any bugs or issues while using the website, please let me know. I'll be happy to help you resolve them. So go ahead, dive in, and enjoy the experience!

Happy coding and have a blast!
